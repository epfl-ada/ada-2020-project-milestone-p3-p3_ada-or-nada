# Milestone P3
Extension Project proposition - Paper 'Twitter proposals'

**1. Title**

Testing replicated propositions from Twitter studies on Instagram: generalization of social media user behavior.

**2. Abstract**

On the 10 proposals of social studies of the paper, only 4 are replicated. The authors suggest 'it might be because these propositions reflect the homogeneity of online user behaviors'.
The idea is then to have a closer look on this statement and test if 3 of the 4 replicated proposals are robust when tested on another social media, here Instagram. As said in paper, we 'Need to retest the robustness of these propositions before we can consider them as universalâ€™.


**3. Research questions**

1. Is there a circadian rythm on Instagram ?
2. Do users on Instagram with most followers post more, i.e. is attention related to productivity ?
3. How is the followee-follwers network distributed on Instagram ?

**4. Proposed Dataset**

- In order to answer the first question, we need an Instagram dataset containing the hour of posting, therefore [this dataset](https://github.com/eldersantos/instagram-dataset) from Github will be used. It contains the time of posting as well as the user ID.
- For the other questions, we will use another [dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/samudm98/dataset_instagram/blob/master/data_set.csv) containing user ID as well as their number of followers and followees and the number of posts.
