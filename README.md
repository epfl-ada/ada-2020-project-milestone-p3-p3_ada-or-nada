Extension Project proposition - Paper 'Twitter proposals'

**1. Title**


**2. Abstract**
On the 10 proposals of social studies of the paper, only 4 are replicated. The authors suggest 'it might be because these propositions reflect the homogeneity of online user behaviors'.
The idea is then to have a closer look on this statement and test if indeed theses 4 proposals are robust when tested on another social media. As said in paper, we 'Need to retest the robustness of these propositions before we can consider them as universalâ€™.
